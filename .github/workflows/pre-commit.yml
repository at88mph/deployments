            ### ⚠️ Pre-commit Checks Failed

            ${{ steps.precommit.outcome == 'failure' && '- Run `uv run pre-commit run -a` locally to reproduce the issues.' || '' }}

            To reproduce the issues locally, run the following commands:

            ```bash
            git clone ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.clone_url }}
            git checkout -b ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref  }}
            uv run pre-commit run -a
            ```

            To always run pre-commit checks locally before pushing changes, simple run the following command once:

            ```bash
            uv run pre-commit install
            ```
